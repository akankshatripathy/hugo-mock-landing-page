# User Stories for Pothole Pros

This is a log of user stories for Pothole Pros, my senior design project that I am completing in a group of 6.

## Features We Will Have Prepared to Present to Judges:

1. As a student enrolled in the course, I want the presentations I have already created to be easily accessible in one place, so that I can easily reference progress and previous work.
2. As a team member, I want to to have basic information about each team member and contact informational readily publicly available, so that judges can contact the team if they have additional questions.
3. As a software engineer, I want all the pages to connect seamlessly with the natural user workflow so that users can successfully report potholes.
4. As a software engineer, I want the location of all the potholes to appear on a singular map so that municipalities can identify the location of necessary repairs. 
5. As a software engineer, I want the mobile application to have live video detection capability so that users can identify potholes in their municipalities on-the-go.
6. As a student, I want the desktop application to have successful login capability for municipalities so that the municipalities will be helped through successful identification features. 
7. As a machine learning engineer, I want my computer vision algorithm to achieve significant accuracy levels so that the repair process is productive.

## Features We Will Add, Improve, and Develop in the Future:

1. As a researcher, I want to see where most potholes are. I want to add alerts for users in high pothole areas to improve the detection process.
2. As a machine learning engineer, I want to improve the current machine learning algorithm to achieve higher levels of accuracy, using vision transformers.
3. As a student, I want improved rewards and benefits for individuals, particularly students who identify large numbers of potholes. 
4. As a team member, I want to create a shared space to easily access feedback and advisor recommendations along with presentations. 
5. As a researcher, I want to create predictive models that will guess the locations of potholes to improve the detection process and alert municipalities in advance.
6. As a software developer, I want to integrate feedback from municipalities as well as users to improve the UX.
7. As a researcher, I want to create an additional computer vision algorithm as a tool to check the existing algorithm to increase robustness.
8. As a system administrator, I want to increase the level of security on this platform, incorporating layers of encryption and verification mechanisms.
9. As a student, I want to allow users in the same area/schools to interact to build awareness and increase road safety.
